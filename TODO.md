###TO DO!

- More and better examples
- A good testing to Reverse/Backward/Forward mode
- Yoyo mode (Forward, Backward cycle)
- A good stress test
- Maybe a TeaTime manager will help with precision and optimization
- Improve time precision ^
- Use arrays instead of generic lists ^

x Rewrite the main algorithm to optimize coroutine instantiation
x Replace Foreachs by For
x TeaTime should be able to wait other TeaTimes
x Lots of things before starting this to-do
