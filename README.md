###TeaTimer v0.4 alpha

TeaTimer is a fast & simple queue for timed callbacks, designed as a
MonoBehaviour extension set, focused on solving common coroutines patterns.

Just put 'TeaTimer.cs' somewhere in your project and call it inside any
MonoBehaviour using 'this.tt'.


	this.ttAppend("Queue name", 2, () =>
	{
		Debug.Log("2 second since start " + Time.time);
	})
	.ttAppendLoop(3, delegate(LoopHandler loop)
	{
		// An append loop will run frame by frame for all his duration.
		// loop.t holds the fraction of time by frame.
		Camera.main.backgroundColor = Color.Lerp(Color.black, Color.white, loop.t);
	})
	.ttAppend(2, () =>
	{
		Debug.Log("The append loop started 5 seconds ago  " + Time.time);
	})
	.ttInvoke(1, () =>
	{
		Debug.Log("ttInvoke is arbitrary and ignores the queue " + Time.time);
	})
	.ttLock(); // Locks the queue, ignoring new appends until all callbacks are done.


Some details
- Execution starts immediately
- Locking a queue ensures a safe run during continuous calls
- Naming a queue is recommended, but optional
- You can use a YieldInstruction instead of time in ttAppend (Dotween!)
- Queues are unique to his MonoBehaviour

And that's it!
