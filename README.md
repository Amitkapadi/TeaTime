###TeaTime v0.5.1 alpha

TeaTime is a fast & simple queue for timed callbacks, fashioned as a
MonoBehaviour extension set, focused on solving common coroutines patterns in
Unity games.

Just put 'TeaTime.cs' somewhere in your project and call it inside any
MonoBehaviour using 'this.tt'.


	this.ttAppend("Queue name", 2, () =>
	{
		Debug.Log("2 second since start " + Time.time);
	})
	.ttAppendLoop(3, delegate(LoopHandler loop)
	{
		// An append loop will run frame by frame for all his duration.
		// loop.t holds the fraction of time by frame.
		Camera.main.backgroundColor = Color.Lerp(Color.black, Color.white, loop.t);
	})
	.ttAppend(2, () =>
	{
		Debug.Log("The append loop started 5 seconds ago  " + Time.time);
	})
	.ttInvoke(1, () =>
	{
		Debug.Log("ttInvoke is arbitrary and ignores the queue " + Time.time);
	})
	.ttLock(); // Locks the queue, ignoring new appends until all callbacks are done.


Some important details:
- Execution starts immediately
- Locking a queue ensures a safe run during continuous calls
- Naming a queue is highly recommended (but optional)
- You can use a YieldInstruction instead of time in ttAppend (Dotween!)
- ttHandler adds special control features to your callbacks
- Queues are unique to his MonoBehaviour

And that's it!
